# Spotify-Clone

Music platform with my own design.

This is a 30 day project. I wanted to try how much I can do in 30 days.

Used languages
* For Web-design and functions: React and JavaScript
* For Account databases: SQLite
* For Music storage: NoSQL database/documentation system.

# 10/30/2024 Dev Note

I decided to use React instead of basic CSS and HTML. In the middle of the time project.

For design, I wanted to use that used to be very popular: vaporwave.
